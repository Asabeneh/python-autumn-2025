'''
Lambda function is the same as annonymous function in other languages
It means a function without name
To create a lambda function we need the keyword lambda

'''
# x^2 + 6x + 9 => x^2 +3x + 3x + 9 => x(x + 3) + 3(x  + 3) => (x + 3)(x + 3) => x = -3

func = lambda word: word.upper()
print(func('Finland')) # 11
